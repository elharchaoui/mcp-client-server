    "summary": "We propose a groundbreaking random number generator that achieves truly\nuniform, independent, and identically distributed (IID) randomness by\nintegrating Quantum Permutation Pads (QPP) with system jitter--derived entropy,\nherein called IID-based QPP-RNG. Unlike conventional RNGs that use raw timing\nvariations, our design uses system jitter solely to generate ephemeral QPP pads\nand derives 8-bit outputs directly from permutation counts, eliminating the\nneed for post-processing. This approach leverages the factorial complexity of\npermutation sorting to systematically accumulate entropy from dynamic hardware\ninteractions, ensuring non-deterministic outputs even from fixed seeds.\nNotably, IID-based QPP-RNG achieves a min-entropy of 7.85-7.95 bits per byte\nfrom IID min-entropy estimate, surpassing ID Quantique's QRNG (7.157042 bits\nper byte), which marks a breakthrough in randomness quality. Our implementation\nemploys a dynamic seed evolution protocol that continuously refreshes the\ninternal state with unpredictable system jitter, effectively decoupling the QPP\nsequence from the initial seed. Cross-platform validation on macOS (x86 and\nARM) and Windows (x86) confirms uniformly distributed outputs, while\nevaluations compliant with NIST SP 800-90B show a Shannon entropy of 7.9999\nbits per byte. Overall, IID-based QPP-RNG represents a significant advancement\nin random number generation, offering a scalable, system-based, software-only,\npost-quantum secure solution for a wide range of cryptographic applications.",
